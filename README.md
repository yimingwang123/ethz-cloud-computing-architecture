# ETH ZÃ¼rich Cloud Computing Architecture Projects 2022

These two projects are mainly about Google Cloud scheduler design strategies. 
Goal of these projects is to build scheduler for latency-sensitive and batch applications in a cloud cluster, and deployed applications inside containers using a popular container orchestration platform - Kubernetes.

### **Important Note:**
1. I only uploaded the **python-related** project work. 

2. Main skills covered by these projects are scheduler design in python and create plots in python.
